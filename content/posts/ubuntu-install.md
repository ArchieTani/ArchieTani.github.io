# How to Install Ubuntu

As one of the popular open-source operating systems, Ubuntu is a good choice for users who want to try a new operating system. Here are the steps to install Ubuntu on your computer.

## Preparation

1. Download the Ubuntu installation file from the official website [Download Ubuntu Desktop | Download | Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Choose the version that suits your needs.

2. Create a bootable USB or DVD. You can use applications like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable USB.

3. Make sure your computer is connected to the internet. This will facilitate the installation process and download the required packages.

## Installation

1. Enter the BIOS or UEFI on your computer. The method varies depending on the type of computer, but usually, you can press keys like F2 or Del when the computer is turned on.

2. In the BIOS or UEFI menu, select the option to boot from USB or DVD. This will start the Ubuntu installation process.

3. On the first screen, choose the language you want to use and press the "Install Ubuntu" button.

4. Next, you will be asked to choose the installation option. Select `Erase disk and install Ubuntu` if you want to install Ubuntu as the main operating system on your computer. If you want to install Ubuntu as a dual boot with another operating system, select `Something else` and follow the next steps to determine the partition to be used to install Ubuntu.

5. After determining the installation option, you will be asked to fill in information such as location, time, and username. Fill in the required information and press the `Continue` button.

6. Wait for the installation process to complete. This can take a few minutes depending on the speed of your computer and internet connection.

7. After the installation process is complete, the computer will restart and you will enter the Ubuntu login screen. Log in with the username and password you created earlier.

## Done

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Ubuntu on your computer. Now, you can start exploring and using Ubuntu to your liking.
